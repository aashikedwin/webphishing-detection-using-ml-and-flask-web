            <h2>Evolution of Phishing Detection</h2>
            <p>Phishing attacks have been one of the oldest and most persistent threats in the field of cybersecurity. From simple deceptive emails to sophisticated fake websites and spear-phishing attacks, the methods employed by attackers have evolved significantly over time.</p>
            
            <h3>Early Days of Phishing</h3>
            <p>Initially, phishing attacks primarily relied on sending fraudulent emails pretending to be from trusted sources such as banks or government agencies. These emails would lure users to malicious websites or ask for sensitive information directly.</p>
            
            <h3>Rise of Automated Phishing Kits</h3>
            <p>As phishing techniques became more widespread, attackers started using ready-made phishing kits that allowed even non-technical individuals to launch attacks. These kits could replicate popular websites and collect credentials without advanced skills.</p>
            
            <h3>Introduction of Blacklist-Based Detection</h3>
            <p>Early defenses against phishing included blacklist-based systems where known phishing URLs were stored and blocked. However, these systems struggled to keep up with rapidly evolving phishing sites that could appear and disappear within hours.</p>
            
            <h3>Adoption of Machine Learning and AI</h3>
            <p>To counter sophisticated phishing attacks, researchers introduced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. These systems analyze various features of URLs, domains, and webpage content to predict phishing attempts more effectively.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Approach to Phishing Detection</h3>
            <p>This project integrates modern AI and ML-based solutions to detect phishing URLs in real-time. By analyzing <b>17 critical features</b> including address bar structure, domain properties, and page content, the system can classify URLs as phishing or legitimate with high accuracy.</p>
            
            <h3>Real-World Application</h3>
            <p>Today, phishing detection is not limited to individual users. It is widely used in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Email filtering systems (e.g., Gmail, Outlook)</li>
                <li>Browser security warnings</li>
                <li>Corporate firewalls and intrusion prevention systems</li>
                <li>Banking and financial platforms to prevent fraud</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
            <p>Despite advanced detection systems, phishing techniques continue to evolve. Thus, ongoing research and updating of phishing detection models, including the integration of <b>deep learning, NLP, and hybrid detection systems</b>, remain critical in maintaining robust cybersecurity defenses.</p>
            
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Our Phishing Detection System represents a step forward in combating online threats using AI. By learning from thousands of phishing and legitimate URLs, and updating with new data, this system helps protect users from falling victim to online scams and fraud.</p>
